title: Lines of code
---

A [classic metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) for pretty much all programming languages is to count the lines of code. Project Wallace counts the amount of 'phisical' lines of code in this rule.

```css
.line1,
.line2 {
	line: 3;
} /* line 4 */
```
