With COVID-19 raging across our planet, sales for Project Wallace have pretty much dried up. Hardly any new paying customers are showing up. And I get that. These are incredibly challenging times. This is probably not the time to make (even a tiny) investment in a tool like Wallace, that you don't strictly need anyway. _This is why I have decided to move my attention to serving the developer community with writing documentation for all Project Wallace's CSS metrics._

## On writing docs

There are so many different metrics in Project Wallace and there's no good explanation for any of them to be found. This needs to change. To do that, I have created a `/docs` folder and copied every existing CSS metric and created a Markdown file for it. From here I have started writing documentation. For at least 130 Markdown files.

## Writing documentation that someone might actually want to read

Truth be told, I think the progress is pretty slow. I've been looking at many websites to figure out what makes documentation pages right. Websites like [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/time) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container) make it look easy, but look at the details that go into these pages. Here's a small list of things that I think they do a great job of documenting:

- Code and usage examples.
- Versioning. It's so useful to have a browser compatibility table or a note about some thing being deprecated or removed.
- Short paragraphs of explanations. No-one wants to plough through a pile of unreadable text.
- Beautiful design. These docs are pleasant to the eye.
- Linkable sub-headings. Don't underestimate the power of being able to link to a heading far below the fold of a page. I love it when a heading is clickable and gives me the url of that exact heading so I can easily share it.
- Links to related content. It can be useful sometimes to read more about a certain topic on the same or a different website.
- A link to edit the given page directly on GitHub. This is what makes open source great, I think. There is no easier way to get started in <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> than to write or change some documentation.

Certainly I'm going to take a couple of these goodies and apply them to Wallace's documentation pages!

## The way forward

This is where I just need to put in the effort and write all the pages. It's quite the task I've set out for myself, but it helps to have a big chunky checklist in Basecamp and seeing a little progress almost every day. I'll get there. Eventually.
