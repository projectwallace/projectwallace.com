Commenting your code is good, but delivering comments to your users isn't. Your users do not benefit from commented code, but the increased file size makes receiving the file slower.

Use a tool like [Lightning CSS](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss), [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/), or [CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso) to minify your CSS and also remove comments.
