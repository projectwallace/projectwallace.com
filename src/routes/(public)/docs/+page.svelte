		<h1>Docs</h1>

		<p>
			Here you can find everything you need to get a full grasp on all the metrics and features that the tools around
			Project Wallace provide.
		</p>
		<p>
			The docs are on the website (instead of in the individual repositories) so that we can link to them from within
			the several CLI tools. Also, linking to the docs within this website helps with making the project detail pages
			more understandable.
