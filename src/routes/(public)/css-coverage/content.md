This CSS Coverage viewer makes a visualization of used and unused pieces of your CSS. It uses the JSON exported by DevTools (in [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage#coverage-start-css-coverage), [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/coverage/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.coverage.startcsscoverage/) or [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/)) to make a single visualization.

- Combine output **multiple** Coverage JSON files into a single overview
- Mark **each line** as covered or not covered
- **Prettify** CSS for easy inspection
