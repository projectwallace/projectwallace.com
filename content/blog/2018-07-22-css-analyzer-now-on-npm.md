As of today it is possible to install [css-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@projectwallace/css-analyzer) via NPM! I released it as 1.0.0, so it means that as from now I am committed to adhering to SemVer and keeping the API stable until a next major version. I hope to find more users and contributers by publishing it to NPM.

```shell
npm i @projectwallace/css-analyzer
```
