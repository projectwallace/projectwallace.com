Use this visualizer to make sure the architecture of your CSS `@layer`s is correct. Cascade Layers can be defined in many places and the order that they are created in defines their specificity in the cascade. A large stylesheet may make it difficult to inspect the correct order of your layers which is why this tool exists.

- See which CSS layers are declared
- Inspect the correct ordering and nesting of CSS layers
- Inspect where layers are defined and used
