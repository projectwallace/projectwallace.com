			'<p><strong>History.</strong> That&rsquo;s the most important bit. The difference is that Project Wallace keeps track of the metrics over time, so it is possible to see what is different from a month ago. The metrics and key concepts are pretty much the same, although Project Wallace has more advanced metrics than the others. In fact, Project Wallace would not have existed if it weren&rsquo;t for the awesome work that the creators of those libraries have done.</p>'
