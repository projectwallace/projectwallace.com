## Conclusion

That was a wild ride along some of the most-used but also most obscure pieces of CSS usage around he world. The goal of this first edition of Project Wallace's CSS Selection was to have a look at how CSS is being used in the real world and I'm pleased to say that this article has shown us some real eye openers as well as opportunities for mad respect and deep regret.

A big thanks to our sponsors wo have made this first edition possible:
