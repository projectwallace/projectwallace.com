Welcome to **The CSS Selection 2026**! In this article we're having a look at how CSS is used at scale in over 100,000 websites. We'll look at what things are common in most websites and discover interesting outliers.

This article exists for several reasons but the Web Almanac is the most prominent one. For several years the Web Almanac has skipped the CSS chapter: a shortage of authors, editors but mostly analysts who could mangle BigQuery stuff to get hold of large amounts of CSS data to analyze and put them in readable charts. Additionally the Web Almanac uses a regex-based CSS analyzer that differs a lot from Project Wallace's analyzer. This has bothered me for years because I think the CSS community deserves a yearly overview as well as that overview having the best in class analysis. Now, I can't crawl millions of websites like the HTTP Archive can, but I can do 100,000 and still make a pretty decent overview. So, that's what we're looking at now.

CSS has taken a flight in recent years witch many new features, properties, values, atrules and so much more. With power shifting to CSS it's interesting to look at the use of these new features as well as keeping an eye on global metrics like file size, units used etc. We'll work our way down from the top so we'll start by looking at global metrics followed by atrule analysis, then rules, selectors, declarations and lastly, values.
