title: Announcing The CSS Selection
excerpt: The most comprehensive large-scale CSS analysis ever documented is now online.

After weeks of scraping and analyzing more than 100,000 websites I'm happy to announce: [The CSS Selection 2026](/the-css-selection/2026)! This is the biggest ever attempt (as far as I know) to look at CSS from a high level and draw conclusions from usage of new CSS features and anti-patterns. It features even more metrics than the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/). On top of that it also highlights some insane outliers, just because it's fun to do, and it may help you feel good about your own situation.

The CSS Selection is a new concept for Project Wallace that I've wanted to do for a long time. It has taken tremendous effort to get this across the finish line but now it's here and I couldn't be more proud of it. There is also a big list of improvements that I plan on incorporating in future editions so expect this to become even better.

The run up to publishing this has been so much fun. During analysis I've shared several statistics and screenshots on social media. People's emotions ranged from sheer laughter to outrage. The design aspect of the whole thing was also pretty nice to do. I even attempted so make a [card-like image](https://codepen.io/bartveneman/pen/azZYqLZ) for previews on social media. It took a little bit of fumbling, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

Another very cool aspect of The CSS Selection is that it's publicly sponsored by [Polypane](https://polypane.app/). That means that I had to work in a few pieces of sponsored content, but man, does it fit the rest of the content well! I had linked to at least two Polypane articles/pages already before Kilian came on board. It highlights how well Polypane fits this article and I'm proud to now have a second sponsor, next to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who kindly sponsor the hosting and deployment of this website.
